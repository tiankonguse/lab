>1.5.2. Structure</H2
><P
>The structure of a shell script is very flexible.  Even though in Bash a lot of freedom is granted, you must ensure correct logic, flow control and efficiency so that users executing the script can do so easily and correctly.</P
><P
>When starting on a new script, ask yourself the following questions:</P
><P
></P

><LI
><P
>Will I be needing any information from the user or from the user's environment?</P
></LI

>How will I store that information?</P

>1.5.4. A word on order and logic</H2
><P
>In order to speed up the developing process, the logical order of a program should be thought over in advance.  This is your first step when developing a script.</P
><P
>A number of methods can be used; one of the most common is working with lists.  Itemizing the list of tasks involved in a program allows you to describe each process.  Individual tasks can be referenced by their item number.</P
><P
>Using your own spoken language to pin down the tasks to be executed by your program will help you to create an understandable form of your program.  Later, you can replace the everyday language statements with shell language words and constructs.</P
><P
>The example below shows such a logic flow design.  It describes the rotation of log files.  This example shows a possible repetitive loop, controlled by the number of base log files you want to rotate:</P
><P
></P
><OL

></LI

><P
>Enter base name of the log file.</P
></LI

><P
>Enter number of days logs should be kept.</P
></LI
><LI

>Make settings permanent in user's crontab file.</P

>1.5.6. Example init script</H2
><P
>An init script starts system services on UNIX and Linux machines.  The system log daemon, the power management daemon, the name and mail daemons are common examples.  These scripts, also known as startup scripts, are stored in a specific location on your system, such as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/rc.d/init.d</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/init.d</TT
>.  Init, the initial process, reads its configuration files and decides which services to start or stop in each run level.  A run level is a configuration of processes; each system has a single user run level, for instance, for performing administrative tasks, for which the system has to be in an unused state as much as possible, such as recovering a critical file system from a backup.  Reboot and shutdown run levels are usually also configured.</P
><P
>The tasks to be executed upon starting a service or stopping it are listed in the startup scripts.  It is one of the system administrator's tasks to configure <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
>, so that services are started and stopped at the correct moment.  When confronted with this task, you need a good understanding of the startup and shutdown procedures on your system.  We therefore advise that you read the man pages for <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>inittab</TT
> before starting on your own initialization scripts.</P
><P
>Here is a very simple example, that will play a sound upon starting and stopping your machine:</P
