<P>
Semaphores can best be described as counters used to control access to shared resources by multiple processes.
They are most often used as a locking mechanism to prevent processes from accessing a particular resource
while another process is performing operations on it.  Semaphores are often dubbed the most difficult to
grasp of the three types of System V IPC objects.  In order to fully understand semaphores, we'll discuss
them briefly before engaging any system calls and operational theory.
<P>
The name <EM>semaphore</EM> is actually an old railroad term, referring to the crossroad ``arms''
that prevent cars from crossing the tracks at intersections.  The same can be said about a simple
semaphore set.  If the semaphore is <EM>on</EM> (the arms are up), then a resource is available (cars may
cross the tracks).  However, if the semaphore is <EM>off</EM> (the arms are down), then resources are
not available (the cars must wait).
<P>
While this simple example may stand to introduce the concept, it is important to realize that
semaphores are actually implemented as <EM>sets</EM>, rather than as single entities.  Of course, a
given semaphore set might only have one semaphore, as in our railroad example.
<P>
Perhaps another approach to the concept of semaphores, is to think of them as <EM>resource counters</EM>.
Let's apply this concept to another real world scenario.  Consider a print spooler, capable of
handling multiple printers, with each printer handling multiple print requests.  A hypothetical print
spool manager will utilize semaphore sets to monitor access to each printer.
<P>
Assume that in our corporate print room, we have 5 printers online.  Our print spool manager allocates
a semaphore set with 5 semaphores in it, one for each printer on the system.  Since each printer is
only physically capable of printing one job at a time, each of our five semaphores in our set will
be initialized to a value of 1 (one), meaning that they are all online, and accepting requests.
<P>
John sends a print request to the spooler.  The print manager looks at the semaphore set, and finds
the first semaphore which has a value of one.  Before sending John's request to the physical device,
the print manager <EM>decrements</EM> the semaphore for the corresponding printer by a value of negative
one (-1).  Now, that semaphore's value is zero.  In the world of System V semaphores, a value of
zero represents 100% resource utilization on that semaphore.  In our example, no other request can
be sent to that printer until it is no longer equal to zero.
<P>
When John's print job has completed, the print manager <EM>increments</EM> the value of the semaphore
which corresponds to the printer.  Its value is now back up to one (1), which means it is available again.
Naturally, if all 5 semaphores had a value of zero, that would indicate that they are all busy printing requests, and
that no printers are available.
<P>
Although this was a simple example, please do not be confused by the initial value of one (1) which
was assigned to each semaphore in the set.  Semaphores, when thought of as resource counters, may 
be initialized to <EM>any positive</EM> integer value, and are not limited to either being zero or one.  If it
were possible for each of our five printers to handle 10 print jobs at a time, we could initialize each
of our semaphores to 10, decrementing by one for every new job, and incrementing by one whenever a print 
job was finished.  As you will discover in the next chapter, semaphores have a close working relationship
with shared memory segments, acting as a <EM>watchdog</EM> to prevent multiple writes to the same memory
segment.
<P>
Before delving into the associated system calls, lets take a brief tour through the various internal data
structures utilized during semaphore operations.
