Simply put, a <EM>pipe</EM> is a method of connecting the <EM>standard output</EM> of one
process to the <EM>standard input</EM> of another.  Pipes are the eldest of the IPC
tools, having been around since the earliest incarnations of the UNIX
operating system.  They provide a method of one-way communications (hence
the term half-duplex) between processes.
<P>
This feature is widely used, even on the UNIX command line (in the shell).
<P>
<P><B><PRE>
        ls | sort | lp
</PRE></B>
<P>
The above sets up a pipeline, taking the output of ls as the input of 
sort, and the output of sort as the input of lp.  The data is running through a
half duplex pipe, traveling (visually) left to right through the pipeline.
<P>
Although most of us use pipes quite religiously in shell script programming, 
we often do so without giving a second thought to what transpires at the kernel
level.
<P>
When a process creates a pipe, the kernel sets up two file descriptors for use
by the pipe.  One descriptor is used to allow a path of input into the pipe (write),
while the other is used to obtain data from the pipe (read).  At this point, the
pipe is of little practical use, as the creating process can only use the pipe to
communicate with itself.  Consider this representation of a process and the
kernel after a pipe has been created:
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=534 HEIGHT=174 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="picture41666" SRC="img5.gif"  > <P>
<P>
From the above diagram, it is easy to see how the descriptors are connected
together.  If the process sends data through the pipe (fd0), it has the ability
to obtain (read) that information from fd1.  However, there is a much larger
objective of the simplistic sketch above.  While a pipe initially connects a 
process to itself, data traveling through the pipe moves through the kernel.
Under Linux, in particular, pipes are actually represented internally with a
valid inode.  Of course, this inode resides within the kernel itself, and not
within the bounds of any physical file system.  This particular point will
open up some pretty handy I/O doors for us, as we will see a bit later on.
<P>
At this point, the pipe is fairly useless.  After all, why go to the trouble of
creating a pipe if we are only going to talk to ourself?  At this point, the 
creating process typically forks a child process.  Since a child process will
inherit any open file descriptors from the parent, we now have the basis for
multiprocess communication (between parent and child).  Consider this updated
version of our simple sketch:
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=506 HEIGHT=145 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="picture41666" SRC="img4.gif"  > <P>
<P>

<P>
Above, we see that both processes now have access to the file descriptors which
constitute the pipeline.  It is at this stage, that a critical decision must be
made.  In which direction do we desire data to travel?  Does the child process
send information to the parent, or vice-versa?  The two processes mutually agree
on this issue, and proceed to ``close'' the end of the pipe that they are not
concerned with.  For discussion purposes, let's say the child performs some
processing, and sends information back through the pipe to the parent.  Our
newly revised sketch would appear as such:
<P>
<P> <IMG WIDTH=501 HEIGHT=142 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="picture44468" SRC="img6.gif"  > <P>
<P>

<P>
Construction of the pipeline is now complete!  The only thing left to do is
make use of the pipe.  To access a pipe directly, the same system calls that
are used for low-level file I/O can be used (recall that pipes are actually
represented internally as a valid inode).
<P>
To send data to the pipe, we use the write() system call, and to retrieve data
from the pipe, we use the read() system call.  Remember, low-level file I/O
system calls work with file descriptors!  However, keep in mind that certain
system calls, such as lseek(), do not work with descriptors to pipes.
