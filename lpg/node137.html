Porting UNIX applications to the Linux operating system is remarkably
easy. Linux, and the GNU C library used by it, have been designed with
applications portability in mind, meaning that many applications will
compile simply by issuing <TT>make</TT>. Those which don't generally
use some obscure feature of a particular implementation, or rely
strongly on undocumented or undefined behavior of, say, a particular
system call.
<P>
Linux is mostly compliant with IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (POSIX.1), but 
has not actually been certified as such. Similarly, Linux also 
implements many features found in the SVID and BSD strains of UNIX,
but again does not necessarily adhere to them in all cases. In general,
Linux has been designed to be compatible with other UNIX implementations,
to make applications porting easier, and in a number of instances has
improved upon or corrected behavior found in those implementations.
<P>
As an example, the <EM>timeout</EM> argument passed to the <EM>select</EM> 
system call is actually decremented during the poll operation by Linux. 
Other implementations don't modify this value at all, and applications
which aren't expecting this could break when compiled under Linux.
The BSD and SunOS man pages for <EM>select</EM> warn that 
in a ``future implementation'', the system call may modify the
timeout pointer. Unfortunately, many applications still assume
that the value will be untouched.
<P>
The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the major
issues associated with porting applications to Linux, highlighting
the differences between Linux, POSIX.1, SVID, and BSD in the 
following areas: signal handling, terminal I/O, process control
and information gathering, and portable conditional compilation.
