<P>
As with signals, terminal I/O control has three different implementations
under SVR4, BSD, and POSIX.1.
<P>
SVR4 uses the <TT>termio</TT> structure, and various <EM>ioctl</EM> calls 
(such as <TT>TCSETA</TT>, <TT>TCGETA</TT>, and so forth) on a terminal 
device to obtain and set parameters with the <TT>termio</TT> structure.
This structure looks like:
<PRE>  struct termio {
    unsigned short c_iflag;  /* Input modes */
    unsigned short c_oflag;  /* Output modes */
    unsigned short c_cflag;  /* Control modes */
    unsigned short c_lflag;  /* Line discipline modes */
    char c_line;             /* Line discipline */
    unsigned char c_cc[NCC]; /* Control characters */
  };</PRE>
<P>
Under BSD, the <TT>sgtty</TT> structure is used with various <EM>ioctl</EM>
calls, such as <TT>TIOCGETP</TT>, <TT>TIOCSETP</TT>, and so forth.
<P>
Under POSIX, the <TT>termios</TT> struct is used, along with various functions
defined by POSIX.1, such as <EM>tcsetattr</EM> and <TT>tcgetattr</TT>. The
<TT>termios</TT> structure is identical to <TT>struct termio</TT> used by SVR4,
but the types are renamed (such as <TT>tcflag_t</TT> instead of <TT>unsigned
short</TT>), and <TT>NCCS</TT> is used for the size of the <TT>c_cc</TT> array.
<P>
Under Linux, both POSIX.1 <EM>termios</EM> and SVR4 <EM>termio</EM> are supported
directly by the kernel. This means that if your program uses either of
these methods for accessing terminal I/O, it should compile directly under
Linux. If you're ever in doubt, it's easy to modify code using 
<TT>termio</TT> to use <TT>termios</TT>, using a bit of knowledge of both
methods. Hopefully, this shouldn't ever be necessary. But, do pay attention
if a program attempts to use the <TT>c_line</TT> field in the <TT>termio</TT>
structure. For nearly all applications, this should be <TT>N_TTY</TT>, and
if the program assumes that some other line discipline is available
you might have trouble.
<P>
If your program uses the BSD <EM>sgtty</EM> implementation, you can link
against <TT>libbsd.a</TT> as described above. This will provide a replacement
for <EM>ioctl</EM> which will resubmit the terminal I/O requests in terms of
the POSIX <TT>termios</TT> calls used by the kernel. When compiling such
a program, if symbols such as <TT>TIOCGETP</TT> are undefined, you will
need to link against <TT>libbsd</TT>.
