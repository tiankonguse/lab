Over the years, the definition and semantics of signals have been 
modified in various ways by different implementations of UNIX.
Today, there are two major classes of symbols: <EM>unreliable</EM>
and <EM>reliable</EM>. Unreliable signals are those for which the
signal handler does not remain installed once called. These ``one-shot''
signals must re-install the signal handler within the signal handler
itself, if the program wishes the signal to remain installed. Because
of this, there is a race condition in which the signal can arrive 
again before the handler is re-installed, which can cause the signal
to either be lost or for the original behavior of the signal to be
triggered (such as killing the process). Therefore, these signals
are ``unreliable'' because the signal catching and handler re-installation
operations are nonatomic.
<P>
Under unreliable signal semantics, system calls are not restarted
automatically when interrupted by a signal. Therefore, in order for
a program to account for all cases, the program would need to check
the value of <EM>errno</EM> after every system call, and reissue the
system call if its value is <EM>EINTR</EM>.
<P>
Along similar lines, unreliable signal semantics don't provide
an easy way to get an atomic pause operation (put the process to
sleep until a signal arrives). Because of the unreliable nature of
reinstalling signal handlers, there are cases in which a signal can
arrive without the program realizing this.
<P>
Under reliable signal semantics, on the other hand, the signal
handler remains installed when called, and the race condition for
reinstallation is avoided. Also, certain system calls can be
restarted, and an atomic pause operation is available via the
POSIX <EM>sigsuspend</EM> function.
